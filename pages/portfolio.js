            Get Set Pet” is a luxurious pet store based in London, UK. After
            talking to the client and doing some research into the company, it
            was clear that the brand needed to have a professional, corporate
            aesthetic that still appealed to those in the technology sector. We
            wanted to create a symbol that represented the company and its
            ideals of pets, luxury and playful. Our belief that a relatively
            small company can still be powerful was also something we wanted to
            capture in the symbolism.
            <br />
            <br />
            We threw some ideas around and started looking to the animal
            kingdom, particularly dogs and cats, for inspiration. We discovered
            that the domestic pets, although van be relatively small are a
            perfect symbol for a company that uses technology to accommodate pet
            owners need .<br />
            <br />
            I sketched out a bunch of ideas for the logo symbol, concentrating
            on the shape of the pets in playful way. I wanted to take a more
            abstract approach and focus on representing the pet’s paws in
            different ways. I started using curves to draw paws in various
            shapes and sizes, but soon realised that sharp lines and angles
            would help me portray the playfullness we were after. I kept the
            logo design very minimal and paired the symbol with clean sans-serif
            typography as seen above. .<br />
            <br />
            I sketched out a few quick concepts for the homepage and then got
            straight into Photoshop. We decided to centre the homepage on an
            image collage that slowly fades from one image to the next. Sharp
            corners and strong flat colours are used throughout to be consistent
            with the logo design.

            I was greatly appreciative of the opportunity to work with my client
            to help build them a solid brand and web presence. We enjoyed
            working together during the creative process and we’re all very
            happy with the result. I hope their investment brings them long-term
            gains in the years to come.
